/*
Write a program that uses UNIX system calls to ''ping-pong'' a byte 
between two processes over a pair of pipes, one for each direction. 
The parent should send a byte to the child; the child should print "<pid>: 
received ping", where <pid> is its process ID, write the byte on the pipe
to the parent, and exit; the parent should read the byte from the child, 
print "<pid>: received pong", and exit. Your solution should be in the file 
user/pingpong.c.
